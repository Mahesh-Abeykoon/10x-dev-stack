# Contributing (10x-dev-stack)

**Got a tool that belongs here?**

We value high-signal tools over massive lists of shovelware. If you've found something that actually improves developer velocity, we want to know about it.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds!

- **Add a new tool**: Found a useful AI tool? Add it!
- **Update a stack**: Have a better combination of tools? Propose a new "Recommended Stack".
- **Improve Prompts**: Refine our system prompts with your findings.

## 📝 Submitting a New Tool

1.  **Search First**: Ensure the tool hasn't already been added.
2.  **Alphabetical Order**: Please keep the lists sorted alphabetically to make them easy to read.
3.  **Format**:
    ```markdown
    - **[Tool Name](URL)** - A short, objective description. (No marketing fluff!)
    ```
4.  **Verification**: We only accept tools that have a **free tier** or are **open source**, or are significantly industry-defining (like Cursor/Windsurf).

## 💡 Adding/Updating Guides

If you are contributing to the `advanced/` or `prompts/` sections:

- **Be Empirical**: Don't just guess. Test the prompt or workflow first.
- **Be Concise**: Developers value their time. Get to the point.
- **Visuals**: If referencing a complex workflow, consider adding a Mermaid diagram.

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  Update the documentation.
3.  Run a quick spell check.
4.  Submit the PR! We try to review within 48 hours.
