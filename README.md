## 🌟 Introduction

This repository aims to be the **ultimate resource** for developers looking to supercharge their workflow with AI. We cover everything from autocomplete extensions to fully autonomous software engineering agents.

## 🚀 IDE Extensions

Tools that live inside your editor (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.).

- **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)** - The OG AI pair programmer. Suggested code and entire functions in real-time.
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)** - An AI-first code editor built on top of VS Code. Features built-in chat, codebase indexing, and smart rewrites.
- **[Supermaven](https://supermaven.com/)** - Long-context code completion tool that feels incredibly fast.
- **[Codeium](https://codeium.com/)** - Free AI code completion and chat. Good alternative to Copilot.
- **[CodiumAI](https://www.codium.ai/)** - Focuses on generating meaningful tests and code analysis to prevent bugs.
- **[Continue](https://continue.dev/)** - An open-source autopilot for software development—bring your own LLM (local or cloud).

## 🤖 Autonomous Agents

Agents that can plan, execute, and debug tasks with minimal human intervention.

- **[Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/)** - The first widely publicized fully autonomous AI software engineer.
- **[OpenDevin](https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin)** - An open-source platform for autonomous AI software engineers.
- **[AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)** - One of the first experimental open-source attempts to make GPT-4 fully autonomous.
- **[Goose](https://github.com/block/goose)** - An open source AI agent that helps you build better software, faster.
- **[Sweep](https://sweep.dev/)** - AI junior developer that handles GitHub issues and pull requests (Note: discontinued but historically significant).

## 💬 Chat Interfaces

Web-based or standalone chat tools optimized for coding.

- **[ChatGPT (OpenAI)](https://chat.openai.com/)** - The most popular generic chatbot, highly capable in coding with GPT-4o.
- **[Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)](https://claude.ai/)** - Widely considered the current SOTA for coding tasks due to its reasoning and large context window.
- **[v0.dev](https://v0.dev/)** - Generative UI system by Vercel. describe your interface and get React/Tailwind code.
- **[Replit AI](https://replit.com/ai)** - Integrated AI coding assistant within the Replit cloud IDE.

## 💻 Terminal Tools

AI tools that live in your CLI.

- **[Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)** - A modern terminal with AI command search and assistance built-in.
- **[Aider](https://aider.chat/)** - AI pair programming in your terminal. Edits code in your local git repo.
- **[Open Interpreter](https://openinterpreter.com/)** - A natural language interface for your computer's terminal.

## 📝 Code Review & Documentation

- **[Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/)** - Automated documentation writer that analyzes your code.
- **[DeepSource](https://deepsource.io/)** - Static analysis and automated code review to fix issues before they merge.

## 🧠 LLMs for Code

Open weights models specifically trained for coding tasks.

- **[Llama 3](https://llama.meta.com/)** - Meta's open source model, highly capable in coding tasks.
- **[StarCoder2](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder2)** - Developed by BigCode, excellent for code generation.
- **[DeepSeek Coder](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder)** - A strong open-source model that rivals proprietary models in benchmarks.
- **[CodeLlama](https://github.com/facebookresearch/codellama)** - A family of large language models for code by Meta.

## 📚 Learning Resources

- **[Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/)** - Learn how to talk to these models effectively.
- **[Andrej Karpathy's "Intro to Large Language Models"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g)** - Essential viewing for understanding the tech.
