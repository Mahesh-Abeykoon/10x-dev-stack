# 🏗️ Scaffold Library

Stop wasting time searching for "best practice" config files. Copy-paste these into your project to get 10x performance immediately.

## ⚡ optimized-vite-react
**Path:** `scaffolds/vite-react-optimized/`
**Use for:** Any new React project.

*   `vite.config.ts`: Pre-configured with chunk splitting (manualChunks) for smaller bundles, and 'esnext' target for performance.
*   `tsconfig.json`: Strict mode enabled (makes AI less likely to hallucinate types).

## 🐍 agentic-fastapi (Python)
**Path:** `scaffolds/fastapi-agent/`
**Use for:** Building the backend for your AI Tools.

*   `main.py`: Async-first FastAPI setup with Pydantic typing (essential for structured outputs).
*   `requirements.txt`: The modern standard stack (FastAPI, Pydantic v2, OpenAI, LangChain).
*   `Dockerfile`: Optimized for production (rootless user, slim image).
*   `.env.example`: Template for your API keys.
