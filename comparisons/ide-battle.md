# ⚔️ Battle of the AI IDEs

Choosing an editor in 2025 is hard. Here is the breakdown of the top contenders.

| Feature | **Cursor** | **Windsurf (Codeium)** | **VS Code + Copilot** | **VS Code + Cline** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Philosophy** | AI-First Editor (Fork of VS Code) | "Flow" State Editor (Fork of VS Code) | Native Extension | Autonomous Agent Extension |
| **Best For** | Power Users who want AI everywhere. | Devs who want context-aware "Flows". | Enterprise / Conservative orgs. | Devs who want an agent to do the work. |
| **Context Window** | Huge (Tab context + Codebase indexing) | Deep Context (Aware of highly relevant files) | Limited (Open tabs + limited context) | Massive (Reads files as needed) |
| **"Agent" Mode** | **Composer** (Multi-file edits) | **Cascade** (Deep flow understanding) | **Workspace** (Getting better, but limited) | **Cline** (Full autonomous execution) |
| **Model Choice** | Claude 3.5, GPT-4o, Custom models | Codeium's proprietary models + GPT-4o | GPT-4o (mostly locked) | **ANY** (OpenRouter, Ollama, API Keys) |
| **Privacy** | Privacy Mode available (Zero retention) | Standard Enterprise guarantees | Enterprise Grade (Microsoft) | **Best** (You control the API/Local LLM) |
| **Cost** | $20/mo (Free tier available) | $0 (Currently for individuals) | $10/mo (Individual) | **Free** (Pay per token for API) |

## 🏆 The Verdict

- **Get Cursor** if you want the absolute most powerful "Chat with Codebase" experience today.
- **Get Windsurf** if you feel Cursor is too chaotic and want a smoother "Flow".
- **Get Cline** if you are an open-source maximalist or want to use Local LLMs (Ollama) easily.
- **Stick to Copilot** if your company makes you.
